# Vanilla Javascript SPA

This project is about building a Single Page Application with a modern look and feel, by using just Vanilla JS. See this in action [here](https://none.repl.co).

## Running The project

Considering this project uses ES6 modules - that are subject to Same-origin policy - messing with files requires a local server like  __live-server__(for instance), which can be easily installed on VS Code.

## Project intentional restrictions:

- No Javascript frameworks
- No DOM/UI libraries such as jQuery or Zepto
- No bundlers like gulp or webpack
- No Javascript or CSS processors/transpilers of any nature
- No package managers(ex: npm, yarn)

## What is allowed/recommended to have:

- A CSS framework with a design system approach
- Including project´s css framework overrides for achieving desired look an feel 
- A modularized yet minimalist code base achieved with ES6+ modules and template strings
- Running a local host server as ES6+ modules require one
- All app colors to be stored in variables
- Any set of icons or images can be used, since they dont´t break restrictions above
- Any Vanilla JS routing library you wish, as long as SPA behavior is fully implemented
